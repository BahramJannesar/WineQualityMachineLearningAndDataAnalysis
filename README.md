## Wine Quality Data Set from UCI Machine Learning Lab
There are two datasets that provide information on samples of red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Each sample of wine was rated for quality by wine experts and examined with physicochemical tests. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only data on these physicochemical properties and quality ratings are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.) [(Source)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)
